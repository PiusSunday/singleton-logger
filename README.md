# singleton-logger

A simple Java example to illustrate a good use of the Singleton pattern. 

In this example, I designed a logging system where a single instance of the logger is shared across the application to avoid creating multiple loggers, ensuring efficient logging and managing resources.

## Problem:
When developing a large software application, you want a single point for logging messages to avoid creating multiple logger instances, which can be resource-intensive.

## Solution using Singleton:

### Code Explanation:

#### Logger.Java

Logger class: This is the Singleton class responsible for logging.

Private static instance: We create a private static instance of the Logger class, ensuring there's only one instance.

Private constructor: The constructor is marked private, preventing external instantiation of Logger.

getInstance(): This static method provides access to the Logger instance. If an instance doesn't exist, it creates one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance. This is how Singleton ensures a single instance.

log(): This method is used for logging messages. (You can replace this with your actual logging logic, I only created this example since it's an open source project)

### How Singleton Helps:

Singleton ensures that there is only one instance of the Logger class. This is beneficial for logging because it allows the entire application to share a single logger. The single point of access simplifies the management of log messages and resource usage.

In the code example as seen in the **Main.Java** Class, logger and anotherLogger both point to the same Logger instance. This ensures that log messages are consistent and that you don't waste resources creating multiple loggers throughout your application.
